# Shipment Tracker Frontend

## Testing with Sample Data

This application uses pre-populated sample shipments for testing purposes. The sample shipments are created using a seeding script in the backend.

To test the tracking functionality:

1. Ensure the backend is running and has been seeded with sample data
2. Use one of the shipment IDs output by the seeding script
3. Enter the shipment ID in the tracking form
4. View the shipment's tracking information and stwatus updates

Note: The create shipment functionality is intentionally not implemented as per requirements. All tracking is done using pre-seeded shipment data.
